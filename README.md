# Listings Sold Ratio Project

This project uses MySQL and Tableau to analyze and create interactive visualizations of real estate data. This data includes total residential listings in Escambia & Santa Rosa counties between 11/12/23 to 9/1/24, excludes boat slips and lots, $100k+. Specified list data, so homes could have closed or gone under contract after 9/1 and still be included. Boolean status variable, 1 for sold & 0 for not sold.

The purpose of this project was to analyze the sold ratio for price categories and zip codes to see what/if any differences exist for the sold ratio when multiple variables are included.
